I would like to present you one of my pet projects – docsim / UkrVectōrēs.
[docsim / UkrVectōrēs](https://github.com/malakhovks/docsim) – an NLU-powered tool for knowledge discovery, classification, diagnostics and prediction. Entities similarity tool.

**docsim / UkrVectōrēs** is open source and avaliable on GitHub: [https://github.com/malakhovks/docsim](https://github.com/malakhovks/docsim).

Caution/Disclaimer
======

Project and documentation are in active development! For any technical clarifications and questions contact us via email [malakhovks@nas.gov.ua](mailto:malakhovks@nas.gov.ua) or via Issues.

Features
======

You can think about [docsim / UkrVectōrēs](https://github.com/malakhovks/docsim) as a kind of "cognitive-semantic calculator". The online toolkit [docsim / UkrVectōrēs](https://github.com/malakhovks/docsim) covers the following elements of distributional analysis:

- calculate semantic similarity between pairs of words;
- find words semantically closest to the query word;
- apply simple algebraic operations to word vectors (addition, subtraction, finding average vector for a group of words and distances to this average value);
- draw semantic maps of relations between input words (it is useful to explore clusters and oppositions, or to test your hypotheses about them);
- get the raw vectors (arrays of real values) and their visualizations for words in the chosen model;
- download default models;
- use other prognostic models distributive semantics freely distributed, by adjusting the configuration file.
