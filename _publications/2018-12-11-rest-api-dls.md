The given paper presents an overview of modern RESTful API description languages (belongs to interface description languages set) - OpenAPI, RAML, WADL, Slate - designed to provide a structured description of a RESTful web APIs (that is useful both to a human and for automated machine processing), with related RESTful web API modeling frameworks. We propose an example of the schema model of web API of the service for pre-trained distributional semantic models (word embeddings) processing. This service is a part of the Personal Research Information System services ecosystem - the Research and Development Workstation Environment class system for supporting research in the field of ontology engineering: the automated building of applied ontology in an arbitrary domain area as a main feature; scientific and technical creativity: the automated preparation of application documents for patenting inventions in Ukraine. It also presents a quick look at the relationship of Service-Oriented Architecture and Web services as well as REST fundamentals and RESTful web services; RESTful API creation process.
